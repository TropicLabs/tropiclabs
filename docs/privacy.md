## Information We Collect and Use

We collect the following types of information when you use the App:

1. Personal Information: When you register for an account, we collect your name and email address. We use this information to provide you with a personalized experience and to communicate with you about your account and the App.
2. Usage Information: We may automatically collect information about your use of the App, including device information, app usage statistics, and other diagnostic data. We use this information to improve the App and to provide you with a better user experience.

We do not share your personal information with any third parties, except as required by law or as necessary to provide the App to you.

## Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide you with the App and to comply with our legal obligations. We will delete your personal information when it is no longer needed.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.
